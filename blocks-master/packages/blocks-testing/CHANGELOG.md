# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). This project
started to follow semantic versioning as of version 1.0.0.

Not every commit needs to result in a change to this file (e.g. docs and chore commits). Every
commit that affects the code in a way that consumers might care about should include edits to the
'Unreleased' section though. Breaking changes should be prefixed with `**BREAKING:**`.
